Like the great and kind father you are, you decide to invest a large proportion of your wealth to a family account which will be accessible by your children only after your death. You put in $350,000 with monthly additions of $500. The bank gives the account 3.25% interest per annum compounding monthly. </h2>

You want to prioritize his education, so you take out half of the balance (question above to the nearest cent) in the family account to invest into a perpetuity.
